# FAQ

## General

### Where can I see my Universal Profile?

You can find your Universal Profile on the Universal Profile Explorer at [universalprofile.cloud](https://universalprofile.cloud/). Just select the correct network on the bottom left corner and use the global search bar to search for your name.

### Where can I manage my Universal Profile?

You can manage your Universal Profile from the dashboard on universalprofile.cloud. Follow our guide [**"How to manage my Universal Profile"**](./dashboard.md#manage-my-universal-profile) to learn more.

### Is my Universal Profile name unique?

The profile name displayed on dApps is retrieved from the metadata linked to the smart contract.

Such metadata, images, or descriptions can be set when creating or updating your Universal Profile. Therefore, multiple users can choose similar names or pictures, which does not guarantee its uniqueness

What is unique about a Universal Profile is its address (and associated identicon for anonymous profiles). The address is indicated with the first four characters behind the profile name (_`0F41` in the example above_). In case the first characters of the address are similar or identical, you can compare the full address to see that they will remain different (aside of the first four characters).

For anonymous profiles, the identicon further helps to distinguish between two profiles if the first four characters of the address are similar. The combination of attributes was done to allow complete customization without lacking authentication.

### How can I delete profiles I have created?

Currently, **there is no way to delete Universal Profiles that you have created** and that are showing up on the [universalprofile.cloud](https://universalprofile.cloud/) explorer. _This includes if you lost access to it or the deployment was not completed fully_.

One alternative for profiles that you can still have access to within the Universal Profile Browser Extension is to edit the metadata and remove all the contents like pictures and names. This way the profile will show as anonymous and only the address and identicons will show up in the universalprofile.cloud explorer and your dashboard, helping you in distinguishing them.

:::info Potential upcoming feature

Removing profiles is planned for upcoming releases of the _Universal Profile Browser Extension_ and [universalprofile.cloud](https://universalprofile.cloud).
