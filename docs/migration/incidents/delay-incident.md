# Delay January 2024

:::success Resolved

This incident has been resolved on the 17th of January 2024 at 2:28pm UTC

:::

On the 14th of January 2024, a sudden change in the LUKSO mainnet blockchain activity, following the [release of a very gas intensive NFT project](https://twitter.com/feindura/status/1746262322950083047), created a wave of pending transactions from our migration system.

This resulted in a longer than usual processing time (from below 20min to few days) as the migration transactions were sent with a very low gas price (1.5gwei).

The pending migration transactions can be monitored from the [migration account](https://explorer.execution.mainnet.lukso.network/address/0xc125fc4f3295dc891e909c56ad7ceb494e9f9644).

:::info

No deposited LYXe is lost or at risk. User migrations will be processed when the speed up fix will be deployed.
