# Supported Wallets

## Which wallets can be used to migrate LYXe?

Only regular EVM-compatible browser-based wallets (Externally Owned Accounts) are supported for the migration. Universal Profiles are disabled, so your funds are kept anonymous and not directly linked to any public persona.

## What if I don't have a browser-based wallet?

If you migrate yourself but don't have a browser-based wallet, e.g., holding your LYXe on a Ledger or Trezor, we recommend installing an EVM-compatible browser-based wallet. After generating a new blockchain address on the installed wallet, you can send the LYXe to your new wallet and begin migrating from the browser. One of the most commonly used browser-based wallets is [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/download/), which can be installed and added to your browser within a few steps. MetaMask also supports wallet imports for both Ledger and Trezor hardware wallets.

## How do I migrate if I have LYXe on a hardware wallet?

If you have LYXe on a hardware wallet like Ledger or Trezor, you can send them to a supported crypto exchange or migrate independently by connecting your hardware wallet to a browser-based wallet. Make sure your hardware wallet supports external connections to browser-based wallets.

## How to store LYX?

You can store LYX using the [Universal Profile Browser Extension](https://docs.lukso.tech/install-up-browser-extension) or any Ethereum-compatible wallet or hardware wallet. Further details can be found on the [Wallet Support Page](#TODO).

:::caution Custom Network

Please ensure you can set custom blockchain networks within your blockchain wallet. Otherwise, you might not be able to see or send LYX within your wallet.
