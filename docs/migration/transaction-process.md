# Migration Process

## Will it be possible to migrate LYX back to LYXe?

No, the official [LUKSO Migration Bridge](https://migrate.lukso.network/) acts as a 1-Way-Bridge to migrate LYXe to LYX. A single locking transaction on the Ethereum blockchain automatically triggers the transfer of the equal amount of LYX on the LUKSO blockchain.

## How long does it take to migrate my LYXe?

The token migration usually takes about 10-15min for the transaction to be finalized and the LYX sent to the wallet on the LUKSO mainnet. This time is needed to ensure security throughout every step.

:::danger Current Incident

Due to the current network utilization, the migration process might take longer than expected. Please read more within [Migration Delay January 2024](./incidents/delay-incident.md)

## What happens with LYXe sent to the LYXe contract?

Any account that accidentally sent LYXe to the [LYXe Token address](https://etherscan.io/token/0xA8b919680258d369114910511cc87595aec0be6D) on Ethereum will [receive the equal amount of LYX](https://medium.com/lukso/the-lyxe-migration-process-374053e5ddf5) on the LUKSO Blockchain.

## How can I see my transaction and LYX?

You can check your balance using the [LUKSO Mainnet Block Explorer](https://explorer.execution.testnet.lukso.network/) and searching for your address.

If you want to see the balance within your wallet, you can add LUKSO to your wallet by manually adding the RPC endpoint as described within our official [Network Properties](https://docs.lukso.tech/networks/mainnet/parameters).
