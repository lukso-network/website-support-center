# Set Wallet Recovery

If you want an autonomous backup for your Universal Profile, you can add an existing wallet as a recovery controller.

## Preparation

To add a new controller account to your Universal Profile, you will need the [Universal Profile Browser Extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/universal-profiles/abpickdkkbnbcoepogfhkhennhfhehfn) as well as an [Ethereum wallet with custom network support](../../general/wallet-support.md) installed **in the same [supported browser](../introduction.md#which-browsers-does-the-extension-support)**.

:::tip Wallet Support

The [Wallet Recovery Setup](https://my.universalprofile.cloud/3rd-party/add-recovery) officially supports **MetaMask**as the wallet. If you experience issues with other wallets, please try again using MetaMask.

:::

After installing both extensions in your browser, you can set up the recovery account. Based on the wallet, you can either:

- use one of the _default wallet accounts_
- import an _account from a private key_
- connect an _account from your hardware wallet_

Open the wallet and add or select the account from a source of your choice:

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

    alt="3rd-party Account Import"

/>

</div>

## Connect the Extensions

After your recovery account is set in the wallet, head to the [Wallet Recovery Setup](https://my.universalprofile.cloud/3rd-party/add-recovery) and connect both extensions to the service.

## Execute the Controller Transaction

The address of the connected wallet account is then used to execute the controller transaction from the Universal Profile Extension.

After the transaction has been executed, your new recovery controller will be set and will show up in the _Controllers_ menu of the Universal Profile.

:::tip Set Controller Names

By default, the new recovery controller will be named after the account's address. To better distinguish between different controllers, it's recommended to _rename them locally_ by opening the controller view and clicking the pencil next to its name.
