# Fund Controller

To use your funds to send transactions from your Universal Profile, you must send LYX or LYXt to the extension's controller. Sending it to the controller will ensure the transaction's gas costs are funded.

You can find the address of the extension's controller within the permission section:

    width="400"
/>

:::info Extension Controller Name

The controller of the extension will either be named **UP Extension** or have the name of the address.

:::

Click on the controller and copy it's address.

/>

If you are using a regular wallet, [add LUKSO](https://docs.lukso.tech/networks/mainnet/parameters) as custom network and send LYX to the address of your controller.

If you are using the Universal Profile Browser Extension, visit your Universal Profile page on [wallet.universalprofile.cloud](https://wallet.universalprofile.cloud/). Then click the send button of the LYX token and enter the address of your controller as recipient:
