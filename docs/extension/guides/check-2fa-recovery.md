# Check 2FA Recovery

If you ever want to recover your profile, a new controller will be added to this Universal Profile from a new extension setup. You must verify multiple steps to check if this new controller can be added to your Universal Profile by the recovery service:

# Verify the recovery controller in your extension

If you visit the controller menu in the Universal Profile Browser Extension, there need to be at least three controllers:

- The Universal Profile Browser Extension (used for profile interactions)
- The Universal Receiver (used to write asset updates on the profile)
- The Universal Profile Recovery (used as a backup for the profile)

To confirm that the permissions of the recovery controller were [adequately set up](../controllers.md#what-are-the-default-permissions-of-the-controllers), click on the controller of the Universal Profile Recovery and verify that the **Add Controller** permission is enabled.

:::info Controller Names

The names of the controllers can vary, depending on the time of your Universal Profile setup. The controller of the extension will either be named **UP Extension** or have the **name of it's blockchain address**. The recovery controller can either be named **UP Recovery**, **Create and manage your UP**, or **recovery-up\<number\>**. Every controller can be _renamed locally_ in your extension at any time.

## Verify the recovery controller on the dashboard

Next, please check if the recovery was successfully added via the LUKSO Relay Service by logging into the dashboard of [my.universalprofile.cloud](https://my.universalprofile.cloud/). If 2FA was successfully added, the profile card will show a green checkmark at the top right corner:

:::caution

If your Universal Profile Recovery controller is not showing up on [UniversalProfile.cloud](https://universalprofile.cloud/?network=mainnet), please check if you selected the correct network in the bottom left corner of the page.

# Verify the authentication code and email

During the 2FA setup, you will be asked to provide an **email or web account** associated with the recovery process. Verify if you **received the recovery email** and **set up an authenticator code** using one of the supported apps. Additionally, ensure that the 2FA code for the Universal Profile Recovery **can be accessed** on your authenticator app of choice.

:::danger

If you've set up 2FA but one of the verification steps cannot be fulfilled, please reach out within the **SUPPORT & BUGS** category on our Discord server or contact our support at [support@lukso.network](mailto:support@lukso.network) directly.
