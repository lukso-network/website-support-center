# Support for LUKSO extension

## Whats the best way to use LUKSO?

It's suggested to use the [Universal Profile Extension](https://docs.lukso.tech/install-up-browser-extension) while interacting with apps and services on LUKSO. The extension offers you a much more user-friendly and feature-rich experience than you would get using regular wallets.

## Is the Universal Profile Extension a wallet?

The Universal Profile Extension should _not be classified as a wallet_. While connected Universal Profiles can store assets, the extension serves as a comprehensive center for your blockchain interactions and reflects your on-chain persona with much more capabilities than just holding assets. Each Universal Profile within an extension holds a separate private key that can be exported into any regular Ethereum wallet.

If you use the Universal Profile Browser Extension to store assets and token, please connect to [UniversalProfile.cloud](https://universalprofile.cloud/) and visit your pfoile page to see your portfolio and send funds.
