# General Support and Help

This category of the help center features general answers on topics related to the use of the LUKSO Network.

## My question is not here. Where can I get help?

Please feel free to [contact us](../contact-us/contact-us.md) any time!

## Where to report issues for repositories and tools?

You can open an issue on any open code repository of the [LUKSO Network's GitHub](https://github.com/lukso-network) page. We are also preparing workflows to handle global issues and improvement proposals. In case you want to give feedback to private source code, like our Universal Profile Extension, please create an issue on our global [GitHub Issue Tracker](https://github.com/lukso-network/issue-tracker).

:::info Customer Support

If you have questions regarding personal matters like the migration of LYXe, Universal Profile Browser Extension or, [UniversalProfile.cloud](https://universalprofile.cloud/) please reach out to [support@lukso.network](mailto:support@lukso.network) directly.

## Where can security issues be reported to?

Suppose it's a vulnerability or something that should not be shared with the public, please reach out to official team members within our developer channel on [Discord](https://discord.gg/lukso). You can send a friend request in order to exchange more detailed information. We are also preparing a workflow to handle investigations and bug bounties in a unified format.

## Does LUKSO have a grants programme?

Yes, absolutely! Please go to our main page [here](https://lukso.network/grants) for more information and to apply!
