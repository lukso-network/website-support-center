## Where can security issues be reported to?

Suppose it's a vulnerability or something that should not be shared with the public, please reach out to official team members within our developer channel on [Discord](https://discord.gg/lukso). You can send a friend request in order to exchange more detailed information. We are also preparing a workflow to handle investigations and bug bounties in a unified format.

## Does LUKSO have grants or bug bounties?

We're happy to compensate if there are severe findings and vulnerabilities discovered. The compensation will depend on the scope of the error or bug. We do not share precise bounty amounts beforehand because of the wide range of possible discoveries.
