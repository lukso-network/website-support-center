# Feature Requests

## Why can't I delete my old private keys?

At the moment, the Universal Profile Browser Extension only allows to disable permissions of old controller keys. If you want to improve security, please disable all permissions of an old controller. You can learn more within the [Controllers](/docs/general/Extension/controllers.md) page. Soon, there will be a feature to manually remove controllers completely.

## Why I can't I see all my controllers?

If you remove all permissions of a controller, it will be automatically hidden within the extension. If you want to temporarily disable some permissions of a controller, please leave one minor permission set for now. This behavior will be changed within the future.

## Why can't I recover profiles from the dashboard?

Right now, you can only access profiles that were imported from an active Universal Profile Extension or recovered from the 2FA authentication. Soon, there will be a feature to recover deployed profiles from private keys still stored within the browser. Therefore, do not reset or delete the Universal Profile Browser Extension. If you have problems recovering your profile, please have a look into the [Common Errors](/docs/general/Extension/common-errors.md) and how they can be fixed.

## Why can't I delete profiles from the extension?

Right now, you can not remove profiles from the dashboard on [my.universalprofile.cloud](https://my.universalprofile.cloud/) or the Universal Profile Extension. Soon, there will be a feature to clean old profiles.
