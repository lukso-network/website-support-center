# Wallet Support

## Which wallets are supported on LUKSO?

LUKSO is an EVM-compatible network, meaning **any Ethereum wallet that allows custom networks** can be used to send transactions and store LYX.

## How do I add LUKSO to my wallet?

This depends on which wallet you are using but we have linked to some common wallet's support guides below:

## What about Universal Profiles?

If you want to use LUKSO Universal Profiles (and we recommend you do) to get all the benefits from using a [smart account extension](https://medium.com/lukso/aa-is-not-coming-aa-is-here-4d87b12ba11a), please use the [LUKSO Universal Profile Extension](https://my.universalprofile.cloud).

## What if I get an error?

Check out our FAQ page, and failing that contact us.

## What to do when the transaction fails with a nonce error?

Your transactions on LUKSO might fail due to a nonce error within your regular wallet. The issue mainly comes from the wallet (like MetaMask) not properly synchronizing the nonce for custom networks that have been set.

:::info Nonce

In Ethereum networks, a nonce is a number used to keep track of transactions sent from a specific wallet address. It ensures that each transaction is unique and processed only once, helping prevent double-spending and maintaining the order of transactions. It's like a serial number for transactions from a specific account.

:::

To fix the nonce issue, please [clear your account activity in MetaMask](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015488891-How-to-clear-your-account-activity-reset-account) or wallet of your choice.
