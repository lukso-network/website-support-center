# Wallet Support

## Which wallets are supported on LUKSO?

LUKSO is an EVM-compatible network, meaning **any Ethereum wallet that allows custom networks** can be used to send transactions and store LYX. Please ensure you are using the [Official LUKSO Parameters](https://docs.lukso.tech/networks/mainnet/parameters) when you add the network.

Here you can find guides on how to add a custom network to supported browser wallets:

## What to do when the transaction fails with a nonce error?

Your transactions on LUKSO might fail due to a nonce error within your regular wallet. The issue mainly comes from the wallet (like MetaMask) not properly synchronizing the nonce for custom networks that have been set.

:::info Nonce

In Ethereum networks, a nonce is a number used to keep track of transactions sent from a specific wallet address. It ensures that each transaction is unique and processed only once, helping prevent double-spending and maintaining the order of transactions. It's like a serial number for transactions from a specific account.

:::

To fix the nonce issue, please [clear your account activity in MetaMask](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015488891-How-to-clear-your-account-activity-reset-account) or wallet of your choice.
