# L14 Network

## How to access my Universal Profile on L14?

If you created a Universal Profile using the [Universal Profile Explorer](https://universalprofile.cloud/) or [The Dematerialised Marketplace](https://thedematerialised.com/) on the L14 Testnet, the wallet is stored within your browser's local storage. You will receive a login link containing an encrypted private key via mail.

:::caution Ongoing Migration

Due to the ongoing migration of the L14 network, the reissuing of login links has stopped. If you lost access to your old login link, please reach out to [support@lukso.network](mailto:support@lukso.network) directly.

:::

## Will Universal Profiles on L14 be migrated to Mainnet?

LUKSO will migrate all Universal Profiles previously created on the L14 Testnet by [The Dematerialised Marketplace](https://thedematerialised.com/), the [Universal Profile Explorer](https://universalprofile.cloud/) or official collaborations like [Out Of the Ether](https://outoftheether.net/). If you deployed custom profiles on older testnets, you would be responsible for migrating them to the mainnet yourself.

## Will previously acquired NFTs be migrated to Mainnet?

LUKSO will migrate all previously issued NFTs by the [LUKSO](https://lukso.network/) and [The Dematerialised](https://thedematerialised.com/) brands, as well as official LUKSO collaborations. If you deployed custom assets and services on older testnets, you would be responsible for migrating them to the mainnet.
