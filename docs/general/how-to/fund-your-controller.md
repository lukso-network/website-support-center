# Fund your Controller

Controllers are wallet addresses that manage your Universal Profile. To perform transactions and interact with dApps, your controller needs to be funded with LYX tokens.

## Understanding Controllers

### What is a Controller?

A controller is an address with specific permissions to execute transactions on behalf of your Universal Profile. Controllers can:

- Send transactions
- Interact with smart contracts
- Manage profile settings
- Transfer assets
- Sign messages

### Types of Controllers

1. **Main Controller**: The primary address with full permissions
2. **Limited Controllers**: Addresses with restricted permissions
3. **Browser Extension Controller**: Automatically created by the UP extension
4. **Hardware Wallet Controller**: External wallet addresses

## Why Fund Your Controller?

Controllers need LYX to:

- Pay for gas fees on transactions
- Deploy smart contracts
- Interact with dApps
- Transfer tokens and NFTs
- Update profile metadata

## How to Fund Your Controller
