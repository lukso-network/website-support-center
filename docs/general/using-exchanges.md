# Using Exchanges

## How can I send LYX from my profile to an exchange?

:::danger Smart Contract Transactions

Never send LYX directly from your Universal Profile to an Exchange. This might result in your funds being locked.

:::

Most exchanges do not support transactions from smart contracts, including Universal Profiles. To deposit funds into an exchange:

1. send them to a [regular browser or hardware wallet](../general/wallet-support.md)
2. [Add LUKSO as custom network](../general/wallet-support.md) using the [Official Parameters](https://docs.lukso.tech/networks/mainnet/parameters)
3. Transfer the LYX from the wallet to the exchange.
